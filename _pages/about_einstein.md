I’m a software engineer with experience in backend development, now expanding my work into applied mathematics. My work sits at the intersection of both disciplines: engineering taught me how to build; mathematics is teaching me how to think.

What defines me is how I approach problems: understanding their shape at first, and then solving them precisely. I don’t jump to solutions; I map the problem first.
I learn fast, but with depth; my work is calm, analytical, and grounded.

Right now, this shows up in the projects I choose: modelling-driven tools, numerical methods, simulations, and backend systems shaped by mathematical reasoning.
My goal is simple: build things that make sense, from the idea to the implementation.
